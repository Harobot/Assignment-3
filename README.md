The process:

Took pictures for the data set
- Using ar feature in the Pokemon Go app
- Training the photo model using my data set 

Photoshop the picture
- Took the picture generated from the AI 
- Did a cut out of the single monster 
- Changed contrast and brightness to make it darker. 
- Added a background of a forest view. 
- They changed the contrast and brightness to match the monster's coloring. 
- Making it darker in lighting makes the picture feel serious or dangerous while still making the picture relatively clear of what it is. 

Adobe Premier 
- Change the opacity to create the illusion of time. 
- Motion was added to the monster by changing the position during different parts of the video. 
- Added fog effect to add the effect of paranormal
- Added Gaussian Blur around the eye to make it glow. 
- I added various sound effects to make the dark forest more emotional. 


Themes I was going for: 
Scary, mysterious, yet realistic 

I wanted to see if the AI could make something fictional yet realistic. Going back to the concept of AI or machine imitating nature. The end product turned out better than expected. By changing the coloring and adding some effects here and there, the video turned out rather well for something that's considered mysterious and weird but still considered realistic.
