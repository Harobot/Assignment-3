The process:

Took pictures for the data set
- Using ar feature in the Pokemon Go app
- Training the photo model using my data set 

Photoshop the picture
- Took the picture generated from the AI 
- Did a cut out of the single monster 
- Changed contrast and brightness to make it darker. 
- Added a background of a forest view. 
- They changed the contrast and brightness to match the monster's coloring. 
- Making it darker in lighting makes the picture feel serious or dangerous while still making the picture relatively clear of what it is.
- photoshopped a set of ruins  to serve as frame for the final product.

Adobe Premier 
- Change the opacity to create the illusion of time. 
- Motion was added to the monster by changing the position during different parts of the video. 
- Added fog effect to add the effect of paranormal
- Added Gaussian Blur around the eye to make it glow. 
- I added various sound effects to make the dark forest more emotional. 


Themes I was going for: 
Fantasy, Mysterious, yet realistic 

The goal with this assignment was to see if I could make a still image, have movement, causing it to feel somewhat more real rather than just a imaginary monster. Combining it with sound effects that sounds as if someone is trying to speak, the result ended up being better than expected. futherdmore, changing the contrast and brightness made the video look more serious and realistic too. The end goal I imagined with this data set is to eventually replace the texture of the monster with real life elements such as rocks, leafs, water, or other natural elements, hence that's something I can add into the project for the final product. Additionally, I should also experiment with text and how that can help shape the narrative of the video art. right now the narritive shown by the video project is limited and very basic, which is something dramatic formulated text can help with. Overall, im happy with how it turned out and it also got me to think about how to evolve the project further, which is always good to have.
